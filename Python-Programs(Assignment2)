Q1. Grade Checker
#Question1:
Take a score as input and print the grade based on the following conditions:
90 and above → A
80–89 → B
70–79 → C
60–69 → D
Below 60 → F

#Program (Python):
score = int(input("Enter your score: "))

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
elif score >= 60:
    print("Grade: D")
else:
    print("Grade: F")

#Explanation:

-input() takes marks from the user.
-if-elif-else checks score ranges.
-Based on the condition, the appropriate grade is printed.

Q2. Student Grades Using Dictionary
Question:

Create a dictionary with student names and grades.
Allow the user to:
Add a new student and grade
Update an existing student’s grade
Print all student grades

#Program (Python):
students = {}

while True:
    print("\n1. Add Student")
    print("2. Update Grade")
    print("3. Display Grades")
    print("4. Exit")

    choice = int(input("Enter your choice: "))

    if choice == 1:
        name = input("Enter student name: ")
        grade = input("Enter grade: ")
        students[name] = grade
        print("Student added successfully.")

    elif choice == 2:
        name = input("Enter student name: ")
        if name in students:
            grade = input("Enter new grade: ")
            students[name] = grade
            print("Grade updated successfully.")
        else:
            print("Student not found.")

    elif choice == 3:
        print("\nStudent Grades:")
        for name, grade in students.items():
            print(name, ":", grade)

    elif choice == 4:
        break

    else:
        print("Invalid choice.")

#Explanation:
-Dictionary stores student names as keys and grades as values.
-if-else controls menu operations.
-in keyword checks if a student exists.
-Loop allows multiple operations until exit.

file.write("This is Assignment 02.\n")
file.write("We are learning file handling in Python.")
file.close()

print("Data written to file successfully.")

##Explanation:

-open("sample.txt", "w") creates a file in write mode.
-write() writes text into the file.
-close() saves and closes the file.
